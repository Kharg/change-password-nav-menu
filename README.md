## Introduction

This extension adds two new ways to change the account password in EspoCRM: 

- Dedicated entity that can be added in the navbar
- Dedicated dropdown option in the user nav menu.

After installation visit /#Admin/ChangePasswordNavMenu to enable/disable the nav menu dropdown option or visit /#Admin/userInterface to add the option to the navbar for every user (ACL needs to be set in the roles).
